# Grocery-List
#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project took a grocery list and gave the user options on how to read the data. 
#What did you do particularly well?
For this project, I utilized python with C++ to interpret the data properly and get an accurate output. The menu is easy to read and use and the outputs are also easy to read. 
#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
In the future I would want to add a better user interface and add some more complex menu functions so that the program can work on many types of data files.
#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of this project was getting python and C++ to work together correctly. I could code something correctly in Python but then it wouldn't output correctly to C++ so there was a lot of troubleshooting there.
#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
In this project I used Object Oriented Programming which is an essential skill that I will take with me for all future programs. This project also helped me learn how to use to languages at once and showed my the capabilities of customizing programs in C++.
#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to keep my program readable by following C++ and Python type standards. I also kept my main function as small as possible and built everything else out in seperate functions. This allowed the program to be maintainable and adaptable.
