# Grocery-List
This project took a grocery list and gave the user options on how to read the data. 
For this project, I utilized python with C++ to interpret the data properly and get an accurate output. The menu is easy to read and use and the outputs are also easy to read. 
In the future I would want to add a better user interface and add some more complex menu functions so that the program can work on many types of data files.
The most challenging part of this project was getting python and C++ to work together correctly. I could code something correctly in Python but then it wouldn't output correctly to C++ so there was a lot of troubleshooting there.
I tried to keep my program readable by following C++ and Python type standards. I also kept my main function as small as possible and built everything else out in seperate functions. This allowed the program to be maintainable and adaptable.
